 cep/
     Ceptrum files dynamically created in phone autolabellingl
 dic/
     Final diphone dictionary final (used at run-time)
 etc/
     prompt file, and some labelling templates 
 festival/
     Not used in diphone bases
 festvox/

     MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients) not used in diphone databases
 pm/
     Pitchmark files as extract from waveforms (or EGG signal)
 pm_lab/
     derived pitchmark labeled files from pm/ enabling emulabel (and others
     display programs) to show the pitchmarks and waveform files.
