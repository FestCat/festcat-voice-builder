* Installation of HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT
==========================================

1. HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT requires Festival, SPTK-3.4.1, HTS-2.2, and hts_engine API-1.05.
   Please install them before running this demo.
   You can download them from the following websites:

   Festival: http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/
   SPTK: http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/
   HTS: http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/
   hts_engine API: http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/

   In HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT, a simple F0 extraction script written in Tcl/Tk is included.
   This script calls get_f0 function implemented in the open-source speech toolkit Snack.
   Therefore, HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT also requires Tcl/Tk with Snack.
   ActiveState (http://www.activestate.com/) provides a Tcl/Tk distribution named ActiveTcl
   for many platforms.  You can download it from

   ActiveTcl: http://downloads.activestate.com/ActiveTcl/

   The above distribution includes Snack and it is easy to install and use.
   We recommend you to use this to run this demonstration
   (Of course you can use your own tcl/tk with Snack).
   Note that ActiveTcl 8.5 doesn't include Snack, please use ActiveTcl 8.4.


2. Setup HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT by running configure script:

   % cd HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT
   % ./configure --with-tcl-search-path=/usr/local/ActiveTcl/bin \
                 --with-fest-search-path=/usr/local/festival/examples \
                 --with-sptk-search-path=/usr/local/SPTK-3.4.1/bin \
                 --with-hts-search-path=/usr/local/HTS-2.2_for_HTK-3.4.1/bin \
                 --with-hts-engine-search-path=/usr/local/hts_engine_API-1.05/bin

   Please adjust the above directories for your environment.
   Note that you should specify festival/examples rather than festival/bin.

   You can change various parameters such as speech analysis conditions and model training conditions
   through ./configure arguments.  For example

   % ./configure MGCORDER=34 GAMMA=0 FREQWARP=0.0              (34-th order cepstrum)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=34 GAMMA=0 FREQWARP=0.55             (34-th order Mel-cepstrum)

   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=1 FREQWARP=0.0  LNGAIN=0    (12-th order LSP,     linear gain)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=1 FREQWARP=0.0  LNGAIN=1    (12-th order LSP,     log gain)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=1 FREQWARP=0.55 LNGAIN=1    (12-th order Mel-LSP, log gain)
   % ./configure MGCORDER=12 GAMMA=3 FREQWARP=0.55 LNGAIN=1    (12-th order MGC-LSP, log gain)

   % ./configure NSTATE=7 NITER=10 WFLOOR=5   (# of HMM states=7, # of EM iterations=10, mix weight floor=5)

   Please refer to the help message for details:

   % ./configure --help


3. Start running demonstration as follows:

   % cd HTS-demo_CMU-ARCTIC-SLT
   % make

   After composing training data, HMMs are estimated and speech waveforms are synthesized.
   It takes about 12 to 18 hours :-)
